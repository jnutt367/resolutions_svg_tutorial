## This is the corresponding README for my SVG animation video on [Coding with JNutt](https://www.youtube.com/user/JNUTT1000/featured)
# All you need to do to enjoy this is clone it and put it into a folder on your computer. Go to it's index.html...
## And boom! You are ready to start playing with the code. My apologies for all the gaps and spaces in it.
## These were in order to see what it was that was actually going down inside of this massive piece of math art. Cuz that is exactly what an SVG is!
### In this video, I breakdown what it took to put this all together and how much

## Here is [One Version](https://resolutions-plum.vercel.app/)
of an infinite amount of possible solutions to this animated illustration. Your imagination is it's limits. And you can have it and do whatever you want with it simply subscribe and go clone or copy this suker!
