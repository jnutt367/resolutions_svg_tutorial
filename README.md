## This is the corresponding README for my SVG animation video on [Coding with JNutt](https://www.youtube.com/user/JNUTT1000/featured)
# All you need to do to enjoy this is clone it and put it into a folder on your computer. Go to it's index.html...
## And boom! You are ready to start playing with the code. My apologies for all the gaps and spaces in it.
## These were in order to see what it was that was actually going down inside of this massive piece of math art. Cuz that is exactly what an SVG is!
### In this video, I breakdown what it took to put this all together and how much 
### we don't know about inline SVG and the power they possess when used properly.
## I have done a little styling and added bootstrap in order to make things look a little bit more neatly put together
### However, this SVG is for you to practice with. My brother Brian Nutt is the artist.
### Go ahead and see his other stuff at [Brian's Dribble, no offense Brian haha](https://dribbble.com/briandnutt)
### This is where you will find the original piece. 
## You can also see Brian's work at [Brian's Behance Page](https://www.behance.net/briannutt)
